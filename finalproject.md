# Trash Talk: A Look at the Garbage Accumulating in Our Oceans

A Christmas tree and lights, a wizard hat, a tennis racket — no, Santa didn’t come early this year. These items were all found in the sea during the Ocean Conservancy’s [2016 International Coastal Cleanup](https://oceanconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017_ICC_Report_.pdf).

Held annually over the past 30 years, this annual clean-up and accompanying survey results provides a key glimpse into just how much trash is accumulating in the ocean — and the results are alarming. This year alone, over 500,000 people from 112 different countries, picked up 13,840,398 items of trash dumped into the ocean, totaling nearly 18.4 million pounds. Since 1985, however, a total of 228,919,809 pounds of trash have been collected as part of the coastal clean-up. Some of the stranger items include 56 toilets that were found in the ocean during clean-up, along with five selfie-sticks and one piano. More seriously, however, the results also showed that the most common items continue to be cigarette butts, plastic beverage bottles, and plastic bags.

Of course this survey doesn’t even touch on the [massive trash vortex](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/pollution/trash-vortex/) in the North Pacific — a mass of garbage the size of Texas that rotates, collecting additional plastic and dead animals. Clearly, we have a trash problem. 

The issue has already arrived to Congress. At the beginning of the month, the Senate [passed the Save Our Seas Act](https://oceanconservancy.org/blog/2017/08/07/senate-passes-save-seas-act/), which calls on the State Department to collaborate with other countries to reduce marine debris, and reauthorizes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Marine Debris Program for another five years. After the recess, the House is set to discuss the bill. 

### So as Congress talks trash, just how does the U.S. stack up when it comes to trash in our oceans?

paragraphs discussing data in the charts
While the data is only publically available for the past two years, it’s still interesting to note several trends that emerge. 
So what’s next?
Future of the study — will be more illumintating whne there is more comprhesenive data available for analysis. 
Measures like plastic bag ban and plastic straw bans- necessary to see how affective they actually are. 
Conclusion: California passing plastic bag ban, see if this has a noticeable impact on next years finding. Currently x and x was uncovered
