Although running largely unopposed in the upcoming 2018 congressional race, Cathy McMorris Rodgers — a Republican representing Washington’s fifth district — raised over half a million dollars in the second quarter of this year.

Her campaign raised $661,458 from April 1 to June 30, with money marked for both the primary and general elections, according to the latest campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.

The biggest chunk of her donations came from The McMorris Rodgers American Dream Project, a joint fundraising committee for her reelection campaign, leadership PAC, and the National Republican Campaign committee. The group made six separate donations over the past three months, totaling $128,338. In the year to date, the committee has contributed $199,714 to her campaign. 

Other contributions during the second quarter were of $5,000 and below, including donations from the Microsoft Corporation PAC ($5,000), Halliburton Company PAC ($5,000), and the American Forest & Paper Association PAC ($5,000). 

McMorris Rodgers is currently serving her sixth term in congress. She is the Chair of the House Republican Conference and the highest-ranking woman in congress. While Democrat and Spokane City Council President Ben Stuckart was set to challenge McMorris Rodgers in the 2018 elections, he [announced in June](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/jun/06/stuckart-drops-out-of-congressional-race-citing-fa/) that he was dropping out of the race due to family health issues. 

Matthew Sutherland, 24, a Washington State University alumnus, is [now the only registered Democrat] (http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/apr/12/wsu-student-wants-to-challenge-cathy-mcmorris-rodg/) in the race against McMorris Rodgers. He is running a grassroots campaign, and has raised $5,147 to date, according to the FEC campaign finance filings. 

When it came to expenses, the McMorris Rodgers campaign spent $228,502 during the second quarter. The biggest expense was $33,177 to pay off credit card payments. The second biggest expense was $12,016 for fundraising direct mailers.

Much of the rest of the campaign funding was spent on fundraising, including catering for events, additional direct mailers, and videos. Among the more creative advertising expenditures was $1,729 on “stickers and Slim Jims” at a local printing shop in Spokane. During the previous quarter the campaign spent $5,580 on “Christmas ornaments for constituents” from the U.S. House gift shop.
