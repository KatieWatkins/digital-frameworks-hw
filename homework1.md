Andy Biggs is a Republican representing Arizona’s fifth congressional district, and a member of the Freedom Caucus. He has a bachelor’s degree in Asian studies from Brigham Young University, an M.A. in political science from Arizona State University and a J.D. from the University of Arizona. Biggs is a retired attorney, but prior to running for Congress he worked for 14 years in Arizona legislature, most recently serving as president of the state senate. 

Biggs ran on platform that promised to work to scale back regulatory legislation and the reach of Congress, including [supporting bills](https://biggs.house.gov/issues/congress) that would prevent members of Congress from getting paid until a balanced budget is passed, end the ObamaCare loophole that benefits members of Congress and reign in “bureaucratic rule-making.” 

He has also been vocal on issues relating to immigration, and introduced Grant’s law, a bill that would require undocumented immigrants who are accused of crimes be jailed. “Everybody in America agrees that someone who is criminally violent should not be released on the streets of America so they can continue causing mayhem and this bill is designed to keep people in custody until we can get them deported,” Biggs said of the bill in [an interview with Breitbart](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/06/28/exclusive-arizona-rep-andy-biggs-grants-law-common-sense-deport-criminal-aliens/). “No more catch and release.”

He is currently a member of the House Judiciary and Science, Space and Technology committees, and acts as chairman of the Environment subcommittee. When it comes to global warming, Biggs has expressed doubts, and praised Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate agreement. “There are credible scientists who say climate change exists; we aren’t sure why. There are credible scientists who say that. There are credible scientists who say it doesn’t,” he was quoted as saying in the [AZ Central](http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2017/04/12/andy-biggs-town-hall-arizona/100124436/). 

Biggs and his wife of 35 years, Cindy, have six children and four grandchildren. In an [interview with Roll Call](http://www.rollcall.com/news/hoh/take-five-andy-biggs), Biggs listed playing the piano, watching old movies, and reading as his hobbies.
