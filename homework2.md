In general, Andy Biggs (R-Arizona) tends to vote in line with his party, and particularly in line with the other members of the Freedom Caucus who are also from Arizona (Trent Franks, Paul Goser, and David Schweikert). One of the most interesting aspects of his voting patterns is that Biggs has never abstained from a vote.

Biggs voted “Yes” a total of 228 times and “No” a total of 95 times. This was similar to Franks, who voted “No” 91 times. “Yes” 224 times and didn’t vote eight times; Goser who voted “No” 92 times, “Yes” 221 times, and didn’t vote 10 times; and Schweikert who voted “No” 82 times, “Yes” 240 times and didn’t vote once. This contrasts with Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) who voted “No” 147 times, “Yes” 122 times and didn’t vote 54 times. Biggs, however, voted the same as Pelosi on 60 different bills, which was higher than I was expecting. But as a measure of comparision, he voted the same as Franks on 298 bills. 

There were only four times when the majority (defined as over 200) of Republicans voted yes and Biggs voted No: 
  1. American Health Care Act
  2. Scrub Act 
  3. Reducing Unnecessary Barriers for Relative Foster Parents Act
  4. Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act
  
On the flip side, there was never a time when a majority of Republicans voted no and Biggs voted yes.
